    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nIn an increasingly globalized world, the cost of living significantly varies across different countries, influenced by a variety of factors. Economic strength, cultural norms, and regional characteristics are just a few examples of contributing factors to living costs. This project focuses on the comparison of countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and their respective index scores for basic necessities. By examining these metrics, this project aims to uncover the underlying humanitarian implications of possible economic disparities."

    "text": "Research Questions\nThe primary focus of this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of GDP per capita and the Cost of Living Index across various countries. Additionally, GDP will be compared with other indices stored in the dataset to paint a larger picture. The core research questions are:\nHow does GDP per capita correlate with the Cost of Living Index across different countries?\n\nAre there outliers in this dataset - do certain countries have low GDPs with very high Cost of Living Index scores?\nWhat are the humanitarian impacts of high costs of living in countries with lower GDP per capita?\nWhat are the broader implications for global inequality and human well-being?\n\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind this study arises from growing global economic inequality and its effects on human well-being. The gap between wealthy and impoverished nations has continually widened, leading to significant differences in living standards. Understanding these disparities is vital for developing policies and interventions that can begin to balance this major discrepancy and improve living conditions worldwide. This project seeks to highlight specific countries existing as outliers, which present with high costs of living and low GDPs, and examine possible reasons for their struggles.\n\n\nPrior Related Work\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between GDP and cost of living, but not many have explored the humanitarian implications of this relationship. Previous research has primarily focused on economic indicators without considering the broader social and cultural factors that influence living costs. For instance, studies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have highlighted the correlation between GDP and living standards, but these analyses often lack a comprehensive view of how these economic metrics translate into everyday experiences for individuals. Additionally, by highlighting the outliers of the dataset, this project hopes to shed light on specific countries that are showing wide disparities in their GDP and cost of living index scores - which may highlight common factors among these struggling countries."

From these summary statistics, we can observe that the median for the cost of living index is 39.4 and the median for the GDP per capita is 22,108. We may also observe that the highest GDP is found in Luxembourg, with a value of 117,746.99. The highest Cost of Living Index, on the other hand, is found in Switzerland, with a value of 101.10. The lowest GDP is found in Madagascar, with a starkly low value of 1502.48, and the lowest Cost of Living Index is found in Pakistan, with a value of 18.8.\nThese summary statistics provide a brief overview of the average and extremities within the dataset, and by further visualizing our data outliers can hopefully be extracted and possible reasons can be explored."

    "text": "Scatter Plot\nA scatter plot can be utilized to examine the relationship between GDP per capita and the Cost of Living Index. This visual representation allows for the observation of any possible trends or correlations between GDP and Cost of Living Index.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Scatter Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.scatterplot(x='GDP per Capita', y='Cost of Living Index', data=df)\nplt.title('GDP per Capita vs. Cost of Living Index')\nplt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (USD)')\nplt.ylabel('Cost of Living Index')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot immediately showns an overall linear trend between GDP and Cost of Living Index, but it also provides information about possible outliers in the dataset, showing certain countries with very high Cost of Living Index scores while still having relatively low GDP per Capita. To further support this analysis, we can compute the correlation score between GDP per Capita and the Cost of Living Index scores.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\ncorrelation, p_value = pearsonr(df['GDP per Capita'], df['Cost of Living Index'])\nprint(f'Correlation coefficient: {correlation:.2f}')\nprint(f'P-value: {p_value:.2e}')\n\n\nCorrelation coefficient: 0.74\nP-value: 7.33e-21\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot and correlation score indicate a linear relationship between GDP per capita and the Cost of Living Index. This means that, generally, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a higher cost of living.\n\n\nFurther Correlation Analysis\nTo observe further relationships in the dataset, we can utilize a correlation matrix heatmap and a pairplot to observe correlations across all features in our dataset.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'Country'].corr()\n\n# Display the correlation matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nsns.pairplot(df[['Cost of Living Index', 'GDP per Capita', 'Rent Index', 'Cost of Living Plus Rent Index', 'Groceries Index', 'Restaurant Price Index', 'Local Purchasing Power Index']])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these plots, it is made clear that GDP seems to correlate highly with all cost indices within our dataset. This further supports the idea that the overall cost for basic necessities, aka Cost of Living, is higher in countries with larger GDPs. To see how the indices alone interact and vary among our dataset, we can utilize a box plot to gain a simple understanding of their values and range.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Box plot of various indices\nindices = ['Cost of Living Index', 'Rent Index', 'Cost of Living Plus Rent Index', 'Groceries Index', 'Restaurant Price Index', 'Local Purchasing Power Index']\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nsns.boxplot(data=df[indices])\nplt.title('Box Plot of Various Indices')\nplt.ylabel('Index Value')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot supports the already known idea that Cost of Living can be viewed as a consequence of other basic necessity prices - rent, groceries, restaurant, and local purchasing power all tie into the cost of living index, which is noticeable as the cost of living index seems to exist in the middle of the other indices values."
